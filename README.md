## Information about RomCom
This was a paired project to create functionality based on a set of conditions. Users should be able to generate a random cover, save covers, access their saved cover list, and be able to make and import their own covers. If a user does not like a cover in their list, they can double click the image of that cover to delete it.

## Instructions for Viewing
- [Try it Out](https://aominhlong.github.io/romcom/)

### How to make a Cover
- When making a cover on the 'Make Your Own Cover' page, import an image URL into the Cover field.
- Add a Title, and two descriptive words
- Click 'Make my book' and it should take the user to the homepage with the newly created book displayed
